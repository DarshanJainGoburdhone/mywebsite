	<h2>ABOUT</h2>
	<p>Although the outline of the overarching story has been more or less mapped out, I still need to figure out plot details and how some specific events shall unfold. <br> As per the 1 minute equals 1 page rule of screenwriting, Life & Beyond will be approximately 3.5 hours long. Though any industry specialists would tell you that scripts should fall within 90 to 120 pages, the story I’m trying to tell simply demands much, MUCH more.<br>At currently 108 pages, Life & Beyond is halfway done. It stops at a point where the narrative splits into 3 distinct plotlines. They will ultimately converge but I don’t exactly know how. Fluidity is key and I fear I might do a hack job finishing these 3 stories just to reach a nexus. <br> <em>So what is Wandering Soul about?</em><br>The basic premise is that of a group of individuals embarking on an outer space journey to seek the cure to mortality. Death and loss tower over the main characters’ lives and it’s in their quest that they will uncover some truths that some will argue should have been better left unearthed.<br> I attempt to explore the dichotomy of fate and free will and its relation to God. Married to that are the endless debates of science vs. Religion, materialism vs. Dualism, the hard problem of consciousness and the existence of a soul which make up most of the drama and themes of the story. <br> On the human spectrum, the many unanswered questions about life, its meaning and the origins of everything led to people developing their own beliefs. Subjective truths are the basis of religions and for many, they define who they are. So what happens when those same people are faced with undeniable realities that contradict everything they’ve come to believe? It’s in those moments that the fragility of faith and human sanity reveals itself.<br>At the end of the day, greed and hubris characterize humanity. When faced with insignificance and powerlessness, the dread one suffers can lead to dramatic consequences. And in Wandering Soul, they materialize into a battle between existence and nonexistence, across time and space, which will decide the fate of everything...</p>
